    "The Toronto Bikeshare Project aims to use open source data from [Toronto's Bikeshare Program](https://bikesharetoronto.com/pricing/?gclid=Cj0KCQiAz9ieBhCIARIsACB0oGIMFeM961gRm3NjO-8os2Q4FqV7dm4YVdArkEpCOa5caaQnc2nRWe4aAhUuEALw_wcB) and conduct Time Series as well as Network Analysis on it. The aim is to predict ridership changes on different temporal intervals as well as look at how ridership occurs for a potential bike from 1 station over a few days. These kind of analyses can assist with operational decisions for the organisation such as when to potentially increase bike availability in certain stops based on day or week or where additional stops can be added based on usage patterns. \n",

    "In this notebook the data will be loaded and cleaned for use in further exploration and analysis later. Let's start by loading the data directly using a Python API from the [Toronto Toronto Open Data website](https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/bike-share-toronto-ridership-data/). The API is copied and used below."

Therefore, as [previously](#FloatDataType) discussed, the column will be changed to minutes as most trips are likely to be below 45 minutes. This is because a surcharge is added for trips exceeding 30 or 45 minutes depending on [membership type](https://bikesharetoronto.com/pricing/) (check bottom of website page for pricing surcharges). First, let's check the statistics of the current `Trip Duration` column."
