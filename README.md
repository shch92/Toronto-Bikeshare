# Toronto_bikeshare
The Toronto Bikeshare Project aims to use open source data from Toronto's Bikeshare Program and conduct Time Series as well as Network Analysis on it. The aim is to predict ridership changes on different temporal intervals as well as look at how ridership occurs for a potential bike from 1 station over a few days.

There is also an interesting opportunity to look at how the change in pricing around April 2023 has affected ridership compared to previous years, which will be covered in the EDA.
